Report: Space Missions Analysis (1957 - August 2022)

Introduction:
This report presents an analysis of space missions conducted from 1957 to August 2022. The dataset was cleaned to remove duplicates, extract country information from the location, and obtain the year from the date. The analysis aimed to answer three key questions: trends in rocket launches over time and the increase in mission success rate, countries with the most successful space missions, and the rocket that has been used for the most space missions and its current status.

*** Trends in Rocket Launches and Mission Success Rate:
The pivot table (PT1) and chart created using the cleaned dataset revealed a clear trend in rocket launches and an increase in mission success rates over time. From the early days of space exploration in 1958 with only two successful missions, the success rate has steadily risen to 90 successful missions in 2022. This upward trend can be attributed to advancements in technology, improved mission planning, and the experience gained from previous missions.

*** Countries with Most Successful Space Missions:
The pivot table and pie chart(PT2) provided insights into the countries with the most successful space missions. Russia emerged as the leading country, having conducted the highest number of successful space missions, closely followed by the USA. However, it is worth noting that this hasn't always been the case (PT3). In recent years, Russia's successful missions have declined, while the USA and China have shown a significant increase in their successful space missions.

*** Rocket with the Most Space Missions and Current Status:
The pivot table (PT4) revealed that the Cosmos-3M (11K65M) rocket has been used for the most space missions, marking a remarkable achievement in space exploration. However, it is essential to mention that the status of this rocket is listed as "retired," indicating that it is no longer in active use.
